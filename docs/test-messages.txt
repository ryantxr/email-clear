Hello ryan,
love the hilarious content and community engagement on your social media profiles at rubber chicken comedy.
I have a wealth planning strategy I can explain in 10 minutes that has increased our clients' net worth by a lot, or they don't pay us anything.
Are you open to a 10-15 minute call sometime this or next week so that I might share the ideas with you

Kind regards,
Jack

ps: just reply with "not interested" if you are not interested :)

Just following up on my last email to you, Ryan?

To recap: we support software teams to move faster on roadmap items, tackle engineering bottlenecks, and handle updates — without needing to hire permanent engineers.

Our dev team operates in sync with U.S. hours and integrates smoothly into your workflow to support feature delivery and ongoing product support.

Do you have time to catch up on a call early next week?

With warmest regards,
Allen / 2Mundos

Hi Ryan - Hope all is well.

Is your team looking to ship product features faster — without the cost or delay of hiring full-time engineers?

Our team works in U.S. time zones, making it easy to move through pending tasks, take on ongoing support work, or advance key features faster.

We’ve completed 270+ projects across mobile & web, and typically embed as part of our client’s in-house team.

Think it’s worth a quick look?

Warm regards,
Allen / 2Mundos

How's it going Ryan,

We just built an AI-powered tool for your inbox called Fyxer. 

It learns from all of your emails, sort your emails, and create drafts directly in Gmail.

There’s no cost to try it. Reply back with “yes” and we’ll send over the signup link.

Well wishes,

Hey Ryan, 

We can help secure from $2 million up to $15 million for 3i Tech Works.

Our consortium of multi-family offices and wealthy individuals are exploring opportunities for exciting new investments including 3i Tech Works and peers in the same vertical. 

Would that be of interest?
